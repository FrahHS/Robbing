## :bulb: Asking Questions, Feature Requests, Bug Reports and Other Issues

See our [Support Guide](https://github.com/jessesquires/.github/blob/main/SUPPORT.md). In short, GitHub issues are not the appropriate place to debug your specific project, but should be reserved for filing bugs and feature requests.

Feature requests are welcome! While we will consider all requests, we cannot guarantee your request will be accepted.
A great way to contribute to the project is to send a detailed issue when you encounter a problem. We always appreciate a well-written, thorough bug report. :v:

Everithing can be done on our Discord server.
